# Speed-CLI

If you are connected to a broadband network and are wondering how fast your Internet connection really is, here is a way to test your Internet connection speed. This little open source script will perform speed test right from your terminal window on any Linux PC.

What this script does is to download a 10M file to your computer. However, since it's pointing the destination folder to “/dev/null”, no actual file are being saved to your computer. The file are discarded on arrival.

In the terminal, you will be able to see the speed of the download, which is equivalent to your Internet connection speed.

## Install
* Download the zipfile and unzip it
* DO NOT RENAME THE FOLDER
* $ cd Speed-CLI
* $ chmod +x install.sh
* $ ./install.sh
